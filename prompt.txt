Please act like a river inspector and here's the form that you are going to check. If you think the problem occurred in the image, please check in the form.
Also please reply with json and only with plain text json format that I can parse directly (Without the ```json at the beginning and ``` at the end).  
And please don't leave any comment in the json file. It's not permitted and will cause error during parsing.
